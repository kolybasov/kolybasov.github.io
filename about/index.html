<h2 id="hello">Hello!</h2>

<p>I am Mykola and I am front-end developer(it is confession).
Most time of my career I spent working with <a href="https://emberjs.com" target="_blank">Ember.js</a> framework.
However, I am not one-framework-fan and really open-minded.</p>

<p>Aside from Ember.js, I tried(and believe understand them) a few more popular JS
frameworks in particular <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes there were need of build tools for my shiny-bleeding-edge-js-projects
so I wrote some <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> code too!</p>

<p>And finally when I finished to writing my custom silver-bullet
webpack config(just kidding I use <a href="https://ember-cli.com/" target="_blank">ember-cli</a>!) I needed
some data to use inside of my app. And there was a few more useful languages/tools.</p>

<p>I started with PHP and <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a> framework. It was almost 4 years ago since I wrote
a line of PHP and have no any desire to go back because DHH influence brought me
to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a> and Ruby! So I started to use Rails everywhere I need some sort of API
and read many articles about the state of Ruby today. Some sort of doubts went into
my head. Am I doing it right? It turned out there is better(there is always better
tool than yours üòè) approach that can solve all problems of the world so
I started to use <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elixir</a> and <a href="http://phoenixframework.org/" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>!</p>

<p>It looks like I have no idea what to use? In some way it is true but I prefer to
use a better tool for each kind of problem. So if I need to teach something new
it is always a joy!</p>

<p>My current location is Ukraine(and citizenship as well) but there are plans to
become nomadic. Also, I have some sort of CS education but who cares?</p>
