## Hello!

I am Mykola and I am front-end developer(it is confession).
Most time of my career I spent working with [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com) framework.
However, I am not one-framework-fan and really open-minded. 

Aside from Ember.js, I tried(and believe understand them) a few more popular JS
frameworks in particular [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

Sometimes there were need of build tools for my shiny-bleeding-edge-js-projects 
so I wrote some [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) code too!

And finally when I finished to writing my custom silver-bullet
webpack config(just kidding I use [ember-cli](https://ember-cli.com/)!) I needed
some data to use inside of my app. And there was a few more useful languages/tools.

I started with PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework. It was almost 4 years ago since I wrote
a line of PHP and have no any desire to go back because DHH influence brought me 
to [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and Ruby! So I started to use Rails everywhere I need some sort of API 
and read many articles about the state of Ruby today. Some sort of doubts went into 
my head. Am I doing it right? It turned out there is better(there is always better
tool than yours :smirk:) approach that can solve all problems of the world so 
I started to use [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/)!

It looks like I have no idea what to use? In some way it is true but I prefer to
use a better tool for each kind of problem. So if I need to teach something new
it is always a joy!

My current location is Ukraine(and nationality as well) but there are plans to
become nomadic. Also, I have some sort of CS education but who cares?

### BTW. I am looking for a job!
